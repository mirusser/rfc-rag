description: Orient agents in the rfc-rag repository before broad investigations, repo navigation, or unfamiliar work. Use this skill to check codegraph health, read repo guidance and the CONTEXT glossary, inspect local skills, choose relevant README/docs, and avoid planning history unless explicitly requested.

# Repo Onboarding

Use this skill when you need to get oriented in `rfc-rag`, start a broad investigation, or find the right project context before working. Do not use it for narrow command-only questions or tiny edits that already have clear local context.

## Workflow

1. **Check codegraph health.** Run `codegraph_status` to confirm the index is available and roughly consistent. If the index is missing or stale, fall back to file reads for all discovery steps below.

2. **Read `AGENTS.md`.** Follow its rules for surfacing assumptions, keeping changes simple, making surgical edits, and verifying the result.

3. **Read the canonical context language.** Root `CONTEXT.md` is the canonical glossary for the repo's domain terms. Use `codegraph_search` to instantly locate any glossary term (interface, class, or type) in the index rather than grepping files manually.

4. **Get the project file tree with `codegraph_files`** (faster than `find`, returns only indexed source files). Use `maxDepth: 3` for a high-level map; drill into a specific `path` for deeper exploration.

5. **Build task context with `codegraph_context`.** This is the primary entry point. Pass the task description and let it surface relevant entry points, symbols, and code snippets. Do this *before* deciding which READMEs to read — it often replaces step 6 entirely for code-focused tasks.

6. **Load relevant repo-local skills** from `.agents/skills/`:

   | Skill | When to load |
   |---|---|
   | `code-standards` | Code edits, reviews, refactors, convention work |
   | `writing-tests` | Adding or modifying tests, or tasks involving internal types |
   | `tdd` | Feature or bugfix work requiring test-first discipline |
   | `verify-readme-docs` | README audits or documentation refreshes |
   | `grill-with-docs` | Cross-referencing code behavior against docs |
   | `improve-codebase-architecture` | Structural or architectural refactor proposals |
   | `planning-and-task-breakdown` | Breaking down a large task before starting implementation |
   | `run-tests` | Running the test suite or debugging test failures |
   | `run-local-sonarqube` | Running SonarQube locally against the codebase |
   | `sonarcloud-remediation` | Addressing SonarCloud findings in CI |
   | `sonar-local-remediaton` | Addressing SonarQube findings from a local run |

7. **Targeted README/doc reads** — only for context that `codegraph_context` did not cover (rationale, architecture prose, ADR decisions):

   | What you need | Where to look |
   |---|---|
   | Project purpose, architecture, capabilities | `README.md` |
   | App internals: parsing, indexing, search, MCP tools | `src/RfcRag/README.md` |
   | Configuration keys and environment variables | `docs/configuration.md` |
   | CLI usage | `docs/cli-mode-guide.md` |
   | Normative-keyword search (RFC 2119) | `docs/normative-search.md` |
   | Architecture decisions (txt-canonical parsing, sections as retrieval unit, single-Postgres hybrid search, Dapper/no ORM, embedding-dimension lock-in) | `docs/adr/` |
   | Retrieval evaluation queries | `docs/eval/` |
   | Release process | `docs/releasing.md` |
   | Test work | `tests/RfcRag.Tests/README.md` |
   | Local compose deployment | `deploy/compose/` |

8. **Before making any change: run `codegraph_impact`** on the target symbol to understand blast radius. Use `codegraph_callers` / `codegraph_callees` to trace call chains through the indexing and search flows.

## Codegraph vs. Doc reads

Use codegraph for **what** and **where**: symbol locations, call chains, impact of a change.
Fall back to README and doc reads for **why**: design rationale, ADR decisions, architecture prose.

## Discovery Guardrails

Exclude `docs/plans/**` (and `.agents/Plans/**` if present) during normal onboarding and discovery. Those directories contain planning history, not current source-of-truth documentation. Read them only when the user explicitly asks for plans, roadmap details, or historical context.

When a file-system scan is unavoidable, prune planning history:

```bash
find . \( -path './docs/plans' -o -path './.agents/Plans' \) -prune \
  -o -iname '*readme*.md' -print | sort
```
