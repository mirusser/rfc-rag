# SonarCloud Remediation

Use this skill to turn a downloaded `sonarcloud-report.json` artifact into an ordered, verifiable remediation plan that respects this repository's conventions.

## Prerequisites

The `sonarcloud-report.json` file must be downloaded manually from the GitHub Actions run page:
1. Open the `SonarCloud Analysis` workflow run on the repository's Actions page.
2. Scroll to the **Artifacts** section and download `sonarcloud-report`.
3. Extract the JSON file and provide it as context (drag into the conversation or paste the path).

The report is generated on every workflow run — push, pull request, and `workflow_dispatch`.

If the provided report path is missing, check `.agents/Reports/sonarcloud-report.json` before asking the user for a new path.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Orient in the repository

Read `.agents/lessons.md`, then load `.agents/skills/repo-onboarding/SKILL.md` to read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and the project READMEs relevant to the affected files. This establishes the structural and architectural context needed to propose changes that fit the codebase rather than fight it.

### Step 2 — Load code conventions

Load `.agents/skills/code-standards/SKILL.md`. Every fix must follow the repo's C# conventions: lower-camel-case private fields, file-scoped namespaces, `sealed` by default, `ConfigureAwait(false)` on awaited tasks in library code, structured logging via `ILogger<T>`, and the rest of the norms listed there. Do not propose fixes that violate these standards.

### Step 3 — Parse and triage the report

Read `sonarcloud-report.json` and group findings:

- **Type**: `BUG`, `VULNERABILITY`, `CODE_SMELL`
- **Severity**: `BLOCKER`, `CRITICAL`, `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `INFO`
- **Project/file**: group by `component` (file path)

Priority order for remediation:
1. BLOCKER and CRITICAL bugs and vulnerabilities
2. MAJOR code smells
3. MINOR and INFO findings

For `hotspots[]`, treat entries with `status: REVIEWED` and `resolution: SAFE` as already reviewed. Summarize them, but do not change code for those hotspots unless the user explicitly asks.

For each finding, note:
- `component` — affected file path
- `line` — line number in that file
- `message` — the finding description
- `rule` — rule ID and `ruleDescription.descriptionSections` for the full remediation context
- `effort` — estimated fix time

### Step 4 — Understand context before proposing fixes

For each priority group, read the affected source files. Understand the surrounding code, the type's responsibility, and whether a fix is local or ripples through callers. Do not propose a fix without reading the file first.

### Step 5 — Build the remediation plan

Load `.agents/skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md` and use its task format. Group related findings into one task (e.g., "Fix nullability warnings in McpGateway", "Add ConfigureAwait to all async I/O in InfraGate.McpServer"). Do not create one task per issue — group by logical cluster.

Each task must include:
- A clear title and description
- Acceptance criteria (what done looks like)
- Verification steps (build, test, analyzer)
- File paths and line ranges affected
- Dependency on prior tasks if any

Order tasks so foundational fixes (e.g., removing a bad base class) come before dependent fixes (e.g., callers of that class).

### Step 6 — Test additions

If a fix requires new or modified tests, load `.agents/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md`. Follow its conventions: one test class per production class named `{TypeUnderTest}Tests`, method names as `Method_State_ExpectedResult`, no shared mutable state, `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` over repeated `[Fact]` tests, and `InternalsVisibleTo` when testing internal types.

### Step 7 — Documentation check

After implementing fixes, load `.agents/skills/verify-readme-docs/SKILL.md` and check whether any changes to public API surface, configuration, environment variables, or MCP tool contracts require updates to `docs/configuration.md` or project READMEs.

## Guardrails

- Do not fix what is not in the report. Scope is the findings list.
- Do not introduce broad analyzer suppressions or `#pragma warning disable` as a fix — resolve the actual issue.
- Do not change unrelated code while fixing findings. Keep edits surgical.
- Do not introduce new public API without confirming it is needed by the fix.
- Do not rename `K8s` symbols to `K8S` for Sonar S101. `K8s` is the repository convention; keep or add a local `// Justification:` comment.
- If a finding is a false positive (SonarCloud rule does not apply to this context), document it in a `// Justification:` comment rather than suppressing silently, and flag it in the plan for human review.
